A metropolis of shimmering glass and luminescent spires, it was a beacon of technology and innovation, teeming with cybernetic androids and sentient beings from across the galaxy. Amidst this vibrant melting pot, a space-hardened detective named Safiro made his living solving interstellar mysteries and cosmic conundrums.\n\nSafiro was no ordinary gumshoe. His keen intellect and intuition were matched only by his mastery of advanced gadgetry. With his trusty photon revolver, holographic disguise generator, and cybernetic eye that could analyze and process information at staggering speeds, he was the go-to detective for the city's denizens.\n\nOne fateful day, Safiro was approached by a distressed android named CY-N13. She was a state-of-the-art cybernetic model with a sleek design and expressive, emerald eyes. According to her, a precious artifact known as the Star Crystal had been stolen from the city's museum. The artifact held immense power, capable of controlling the very fabric of space and time. Safiro knew that in the wrong hands, it could bring about unimaginable chaos and destruction.\n\nAs Safiro delved deeper into the case, he stumbled upon a shady character named Zaltar - a cunning lizard swindler known for his involvement in various illicit activities. Zaltar was a slippery foe, always managing to stay one step ahead of the law. But Safiro was unlike any other pursuer Zaltar had encountered before.\n\nWith the help of CY-N13 and her advanced hacking skills, Safiro infiltrated Zaltar's criminal network, navigating through a labyrinth of encrypted data and firewalls. They discovered that Zaltar had orchestrated the heist with the intention of selling the Star Crystal to the highest bidder on the black market.\n\nThe trail led Safiro and CY-N13 to an abandoned asteroid mine on the outskirts of Crystal City. There, they found Zaltar and his henchmen preparing to hand over the Star Crystal to a mysterious buyer. As they moved in to apprehend the criminals, an intense firefight erupted, with Safiro and CY-N13 battling their way through waves of armed droids and henchmen.\n\nIn the heat of the battle, Zaltar attempted to make his escape, clutching the Star Crystal in his scaly hands. Safiro pursued him relentlessly, chasing him through the mine's narrow tunnels and across precarious catwalks. Just as Zaltar reached his escape ship, Safiro lunged at him, snatching the Star Crystal from his grasp at the last moment.\n\nWith the artifact secured, Safiro and CY-N13 returned to Crystal City, where they were hailed as heroes. The Star Crystal was returned to the museum, and Zaltar was finally brought to justice for his crimes.\n\nIn the aftermath of the case, Safiro's reputation as the premier space gumshoe of Crystal City was solidified. He continued to solve mysteries and protect the city's inhabitants from the various threats that lurked in the shadows of the cosmos. And though he knew that danger would never be far away, Safiro was ready for whatever challenges the universe had in store for him."]},{"id":108,"type":"IF_DisplayText","pos":[1800.5692138671875,-98.99299621582031],"size":[343.787841796875,240.4427947998047],"flags":{},"order":50,"mode":4,"inputs":[{"name":"text","type":"STRING","link":238,"widget":{"name":"text"}}],"outputs":[{"name":"text","type":"STRING","links":null,"tooltip":"Full text content"},{"name":"text_list","type":"STRING","links":null,"tooltip":"Individual lines as separate outputs","shape":6},{"name":"count","type":"INT","links":null,"tooltip":"Total number of non-empty lines"},{"name":"selected","type":"STRING","links":null,"tooltip":"Currently selected line based on select input"}],"properties":{"Node name for S&R":"IF_DisplayText"},"widgets_values":["",0,"\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n~*~aesthetic~*~, [4/5 stars] ***** Here are five prompts that reflect the unified style and aesthetic based on retro-futuristic themes, with Frank Frazetta's classic influence\n~*~aesthetic~*~, [4/5 stars] ***** Here are five illustration prompts tailored to Frank Frazetta's style, incorporating retro-futuristic elements and adhering to the specified guidelines\n~*~aesthetic~*~, [4/5 stars] ***** Here are five detailed prompts based on the unifying elements specified\n~*~aesthetic~*~, [4/5 stars] ***** Here are five detailed prompts for Stable Diffusion 3.5 to create book illustrations that unify elements inspired by Classic Futurism, sense of adventure and exploration, dramatic lighting, and the style of Frank Frazetta\n~*~aesthetic~*~, [4/5 stars] ***** Here are five prompts generated according to the guidelines provided\n~*~aesthetic~*~, [4/5 stars] ***** Here are five detailed prompts for Stable Diffusion 3.5 to generate illustrations that capture the essence of Retro-Futurism\n~*~aesthetic~*~, [4/5 stars] ***** Here are five prompts that incorporate contrasting colors to amplify dramatic moments in book illustrations\n~*~aesthetic~*~, [4/5 stars] ***** Here are five detailed prompts for Stable Diffusion 3.5 to create book illustrations based on your artistic inspirations"]},{"id":110,"type":"SaveImage","pos":[384,1197],"size":[592.87255859375,580.8143310546875],"flags":{},"order":57,"mode":4,"inputs":[{"name":"images","type":"IMAGE","link":298}],"outputs":[],"properties":{},"widgets_values":["Proteus"]},{"id":111,"type":"IF_TextTyper","pos":[219.84603881835938,-697.392333984375],"size":[546.4723510742188,217.6768798828125],"flags":{},"order":6,"mode":4,"inputs":[],"outputs":[{"name":"STRING","type":"STRING","links":[],"slot_index":0}],"properties":{"Node name for S&R":"IF_TextTyper"},"widgets_values":[" Describe the scene in order to stablish the ar direaction of the painting from the point of view of a Frank Frazzetta mantaing an unified style and aesthethics base on retro futurism paintings from the 30's by Frazetta \nthe response should follow the following structure:\nUnifying Themes:\nThis composition serves as a prime example of how to maintain Frank Frazetta’s unified style and aesthetic.
